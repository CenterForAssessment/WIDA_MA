	CSEMs are required in SGPstateData to simulate SGPs for confidence interval calculations. Confidence intervals will not be calculated.
	NOTE: Only two years of data present. Minimum default of 3 years of panel data for SGP analyses changed to 2. Please confirm this is consistent with analyses you wish to perform.
